## Workshop on Functional Art, Music, Modeling and Design (FARM)

<img src="/files/farm-lambda-small.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;" />

**9th September, 2017**, co-located with
[ICFP 2017](http://icfp17.sigplan.org/home) in Oxford, United Kingdom

### About

The ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music,
Modelling and Design (FARM) gathers together people who are harnessing
functional techniques in the pursuit of creativity and expression.

Functional Programming has emerged as a mainstream software
development paradigm, and its artistic and creative use is booming. A
growing number of software toolkits, frameworks and environments for
art, music and design now employ functional programming languages and
techniques. FARM is a forum for exploration and critical evaluation of
these developments, for example to consider potential benefits of
greater consistency, tersity, and closer mapping to a problem domain.

#### Workshop Registration

You can register for the FARM workshop through
the
[ICFP registration page](http://icfp17.sigplan.org/attending/registration).
Early registration deadline is **Aug 4**!

At least one author of each accepted submission must register and present their paper at the workshop. 

#### Performance Evening Registration

You can get a ticket for the Performance
evening
[here](https://oldfirestation.org.uk/whats-on/?ts_routing=/shows/873576176).
Admission is free - the Old Fire Station asks for a small contribution.

### Performance Evening

The traditional
**[FARM performance evening](https://oldfirestation.org.uk/whats-on/?ts_routing=/shows/873576176)** 
will be the final event of ICFP 2017 on **September 9, at 7:30PM**.  
It will happen at the
[Old Fire Station](https://oldfirestation.ticketsolve.com/venues/126561395/shows).

Tickets can be
had
[here](https://oldfirestation.org.uk/whats-on/?ts_routing=/shows/873576176).

An evening of strange and wonderful music and audio/visual work made
from computer code. Featuring an international line-up of artists,
including groundbreaking livecoders who work directly with the innards
of software, writing and manipulating code while a computer runs it,
projecting their screens so you can see the code behind the
performance. Performances will include: extreme manipulation of the
Amen breakbeat, two audio-visual performances where algorithms bring
shape, colour and sound together, an algorithmic take on Hindustani
music, and an audio-visual journey into Lambda calculus. 

In addition Columbian
composer
[Alexandra Cardenas](http://cargocollective.com/tiemposdelruido), also
known for her performances at Algoraves (algorithmic raves) will give
a keynote live coding performance, creating live music using the
algorithmic pattern language Tidalcycles.

More information on the program is [here](performance.html).

#### Lineup:

* Alexandra Cárdenas: Keynote performance
* Joe Beedles
* Filippo Guida
* Claude Heiland-Allen
* Nick Rothwell
* Neil C Smith
