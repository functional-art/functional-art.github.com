# Performance Evening

### [Old Fire Station](https://oldfirestation.ticketsolve.com/venues/126561395/shows) Oxford, UK

#### 9 September 2017, 7:30PM-9:30PM

An evening of strange and wonderful music and audio/visual work made
from computer code. Featuring an international line-up of artists,
including groundbreaking livecoders who work directly with the innards
of software, writing and manipulating code while a computer runs it,
projecting their screens so you can see the code behind the
performance. Performances will include: extreme manipulation of the
Amen breakbeat, two audio-visual performances where algorithms bring
shape, colour and sound together, an algorithmic take on Hindustani
music, and an audio-visual journey into Lambda calculus.

Performance Notes and Bios
==========================

Alexandra Cárdenas will perform through live coding, combining her
interests in improvisation, composition, programming, live electronics
and traditional music. Alexandra projects her screen for the audience
to witness what she is writing on her computer. Using SuperDirt (a
SuperCollider implementation of the Dirt sampler for the TidalCycles
programming language) Alexandra creates her own sounds in
SuperCollider and sequences them using patterns written in real time
with the software TidalCycles.

### Biography

Composer, programmer and improviser of music, Cárdenas has
followed a path from Western classical composition to improvisation
and live electronics. Using open source software, her work is focused
on the exploration of the musicality of code and the algorithmic
behaviour of music, especially through live coding. Currently she
lives in Berlin, Germany recently completing her masters in Sound
Studies at the Berlin University of the Arts.

Joe Beedles has custom-built a 
system (designed in Max) which allows for live audiovisual performance
through employing functional programming techniques, algorithms,
procedural drawing and seeded autonomous computation. In its current
state he interacts with the system in an improvisatory manner, creating
rhythmical patterns, seeding upcoming changes to the structure and
directing the flow of the performance. A direct visual component,
consisting of abstract geometry and shaded hues, works alongside the
audio to create a pseudo-synesthetic experience. There is an emphasis
placed on the live, real-time, generative aspect of the performance
with a focus on interactivity between performer, computer, audience
and the space. MSP users such as Autechre have been heavily
influential both aesthetically and conceptually to his practice -- he
likes to abstract elements of techno, noise and glitch fusing FM
synthesis alongside found sound and acoustic recordings. Visually he is
inspired by a combination of early Windows screensavers (Beziers),
building architecture (Antoni Gaudi), oscilloscopes (Robin Fox),
Op/Kinetic art (Naum Gabo) and emergent patterns through natural light
(shadows and clouds).

### Biography
In his work, young Manchester based audiovisual artist Joe Beedles,
draws on live recordings and synthesized noise; he focuses on concepts
surrounding club music abstraction, blurring the line between ‘the
real’ and ‘the simulated’. His current emphasis is on generative
systems for live performance, providing audiences with highly-detailed
compositions, emphasising magnified yet obscured soundscapes.  Upon
premiering his work at The Banff Centre in March 2016, Beedles has
continued to develop his live set both technically and conceptually,
culminating in solo performances, particularly within the Algorave
movement and Test Card (Manchester). Beedles – who also goes by the
artist name Native –- releases on London based label Laura Lies In. His
output is varied with stylistic themes of vocal manipulation,
shimmering harmonic structures, swathes of textural ambience and
deconstructed technoise. Visually simple geometry is abstracted in
reaction to the audio in a pseudo-synesthetic fashion. His EP
‘Polaris’ was released in 2016.

### Biography

Many studies show how synaesthetic phenomenon induced by images are
able to excite the auditory cortex, giving an evidence of the
multi-modality of sound experience itself and raising
new questions regarding the complementarity of music and visual art
already suggested by John Whitney.

In his performance, Filippo Guida deepens some aspects of this theory, already
subject of his past works, by manipulating complex video materials (in
this case human body gestures) using sound based generative techniques
and languages:

- The generative process (code) projected near the video contents is a
  guarantee that the development of graphics materials is made using
  musical techniques (intrinsic feature of sound based languages).
- The correspondences between music and body movement, already proved
  by multi-sensory perception studies, allow to address a gesture and
  any image movement as a musical relevant event, rather than abstract
  video materials.

The result is a sort of artistic application of VJ techniques through
live coding languages (TidalCycles) using a custom made software to
manage the video samples (VideoDirt).

### GULCII (Graphical Untyped Lambda Calculus Interactive Interpreter)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eXAURIGlCKw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

GULCII is an untyped lambda calculus interpreter supporting interactive
modification of a running program with graphical display of graph reduction.
Lambda calculus is a minimal prototypical functional programming language
developed by Alonzo Church in the 1930s.  Church encoding uses folds to
represent data as higher-order functions.  Dana Scott's encoding composes
algebraic data types as functions.  Each has strengths and weaknesses.

The performance is a code recital, with the internal state of the interpreter
visualized and sonified.  Part 1 introduces Church encoding.  Part 2 develops
Scott encoding.  An interlude takes in two non-terminating loops, each with
their own intrinsic computational rhythm.  Finally, Part 3 tests an equivalence
between Church and Scott numerals.

### Biography

Claude Heiland-Allen is an artist from London UK interested in the complex
emergent behaviour of simple systems, esoteric geometries, and mathematical
aesthetics.  Using computer software, and programming his own, has been a
part of his practice for both sound and vision since the mid 1990s.

First exposed to functional programming in his first year at Oxford University
at the turn of the century, in the form of Haskell (the language which his
present-day GULCII is implemented in), he also spends a significant portion of
his time writing code for art's sake in other languages like C and GLSL.  Over
the last decade he has performed and presented across Europe and beyond.

### AMEN $ Mother Function

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mGB-Gy7ZDCU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

One sample, one function -- a live-coded, single function demolition of
the most ubiquitous sample in modern music. This new performance work
is both an essay in conceptual minimalism and an attempt at filling
the dance floor with the aid of one wavetable and a little maths.

Entirely created within the context of a single, pure function running
at audio rate, this performance starts with a sawtooth LFO reading
from a wavetable filled with the Amen break. Through the course of the
performance, the Amen break is gradually unmade into new rhythms,
melodic and synthetic sounds. Working with a single sample at a time,
eschewing recursion and randomness, provides a restrictive but
rewarding creative challenge.

The silent $ in the title (also used in the code), is in tribute to
Gregory C. Coleman, the original drummer of the Amen break, who died
homeless and broke.

### Biography

Neil C Smith‘s work explores ways of opening up and challenging the
nature of creativity itself, in particular through the use of
technology. Working sonically and visually, solo and in collaboration,
he creates live improvised performances, and context-specific
generative and interactive installations. His work exists in real-time
and real-space – each moment unique and unrepeatable. Based in Oxford,
he has shown work and performed across the UK and in Europe/Canada. He
is also lead developer of Praxis LIVE, the open-source hybrid visual
environment for live creative coding used in this
performance.

### `:heart:` `:skull-crossbones:`

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qNmYrKI1E44" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

A musical and visual performance binding Unity, Emacs and
Supercollider with Sonic Pi. Combining the quality and performance of
the Unity Games engine, the power of manipulating text through Emacs
and the musical range and diversity of the SuperCollider engine and
Sonic Pi. While samples and software+hardware synths are the main
musical tools, a lot has gone into their creation. Samples have been
sufficiently smashed into tiny pieces through Clojure based DSP
techniques, software synths have been grown in vats of QuickCheck
(exploding with state spaces) and hardware synths have been throughly
corrupted through state mutating code (sorry). What has been done to
Emacs is probably best left to your imagination and the source control
history.

A performance which breaks down the tools and languages of
programming, to rediscover how they enable us all.

### Biography
Joseph Wilk's path into creating music started on a journey to use Artificial
intelligence to generate music to send his new born daughter to
sleep. It lead down a path of exploring machine creativity and then
performing live coding of music and visuals. Most of his work now
explores that intersection, creating a visual and musical curated live
experience for the viewers. Wilk likes to tell a story, and play with
concepts of programming using them in novel and unintended
ways. Exploring what code means as a musical instrument and learning
for himself, how he can express himself while sharing with people, what's
possible with code. That programming is not just a path to creating a
Silicon Valley startup but a form of self expression.
