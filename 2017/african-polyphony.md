# African Polyphony and Polyrhythm

### Chris Ford (ThoughtWorks, UK)

Ethnomusicologists face a dilemma: either shoehorn African music into
European notation, or create custom DSLs that can only be understood by a
select band of European ethnomusicologists. Computational musicologists can
solve this problem, because we have principled ways of modelling specific
idioms in terms of general computation. What's more, our models can be
executed to generate actual music.

Simha Arom is a French-Israeli ethnomusicologist. In the book from which the title of this demonstration
is borrowed, he describes the principles underlying the musical system of
traditional central African polyphony and polyrhythm. Arom invented
ingenious recording techniques for deconstructing and systematising musical
cultures that had no previous tradition of musical theory. He tested his
models by using them to recreate music and inviting central African
musicians to critique the results.

This demonstration will take examples of
Central African musical compositions notated in Arom's _African Polyphony
and Polyrhythm_ and render them in Lisp, specifically the Leipzig
composition library for Clojure. I will show that the programmatic approach
is able to clearly articulate musical structure that Arom's notational
scheme leaves implicit (or delegates to the accompanying text to
describe).
I will of course also play the examples for the audience, because
as Arom quotes LÃ©vi-Strauss, "The proof of the analysis is in the
synthesis."
