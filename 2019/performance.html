<h1 id="performance-notes-and-bios">Performance Notes and Bios</h1>

<p>What follows is a list of performers with brief notes edited from
performer submissions about their performances and bios.</p>


<h1 id="rahmanrothwell">Khyal Geometries: Functional Live-Coding for Sitar and DAW</h1>

<p>Khyal Geometries is a new project which combines classical, jazz and
folk technique on the sitar with improvised live-coding of a digital
audio workstation. Modal melodies and choral harmonies on the sitar
are combined with synthesis, looping and effects processing mediated
in real time by a functional language, resulting in fugues and canons
of soundscape which morph from rich and ambient to rhythmic and
syncopated.</p>

<h3 id="shama-rahman"><a href="https://shamarahman.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shama Rahman</a></h3>

<p>Shama Sarwat Rahman is a British singer-songwriter, composer, sitarist, storyteller, performance artist, filmmaker, actress and neuroscientist.</p>

<p>Her albums modernise the sitar (lineage Pt Ravi Shankar), arranged centrally within layered harmonies, electronic soundscapes & complex grooves to showcase it in different genres and instrumentation. From jazz to dubstep, punk to folk, trip hop to hip hop, swing to bosa nova, her stories start life as poems & take flight as cross-genre songs.</p>

<h3 id="nick-rothwell"><a href="http://cassiel.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nick Rothwell</a></h3>

<p>Nick Rothwell is a composer, performer, software architect, coder and visual artist. He has built media performance systems for projects with Ballett Frankfurt and Vienna Volksoper (for choreographer Michael Klien), and interactive installations for Sonic Arts Network, TECHNE (Istanbul) and Kinetica (London).

As a collaborator with body>data>space he has developed performance systems, software visuals and sound scores for projects at CIANT (Prague), Vo'Arte (Lisbon) and in London, including large-scale installation for Nesta's FutureFest. He has also composed sound scores for Shobana Jeyasingh Dance and developed algorithmic visuals with sculptor Simeon Nelson and composer Rob Godman for large-scale outdoor installations in Poland, Estonia, Cambridge Music Festival and Lumiere (London / Durham).

He has been working over the last few years with choreographer Wayne McGregor in software/media projects including the Choreographic Language Agent (a graphical coding environment for movement), Becoming (a virtual AI-based eleventh dancer for the company) and Autobiography (an algorithmic system which uses McGregor's DNA code to establish the sequence order of the choreography).

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="ford">Leipzig Live</h2>

<p>Leipzig is a music theory library created to represent Bach’s
canons. Leipzig uses functional programming concepts in the Clojure
programming language as an alternative notation.  In the performance
Chris Ford will use live looping to play pieces as he writes them, the
process of iterating the code mirroring the development of the
music. I will also complement it with live performance of harmonica
and melodica.</p>

<h3 id="chris-ford-thoughtworks-spain"><a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/profiles/chris-ford" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Ford, ThoughtWorks Spain</a></h3>

<p>Chris began to make music with code to compensate for his poor piano
technique. It was only later that he realised that programming offers
deep insight into musical structures. Over the past few years, Chris
has given many talks presenting music theory to programming audiences,
covering topics including European classical music, complexity theory,
jazz, central African polyrhythms and tuning systems. His work with
ThoughtWorks has taken him to many places around the world. Currently,
he lives and works in Barcelona.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h1 id="quick">Ugly Purse Dog</h1>

<p>Ugly Purse Dog is a functionally-based, algorithmically generated and
interactive jazz piece.  In this performance, Dony Quick will play
piano solos during some sections, to which the computer will listen
respond with its own solos in a different instrument.</p>

<h3 id="donya-quick-stevens-institute-of-technology"><a href="http://donyaquick.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donya Quick, Stevens Institute of Technology</a></h3>

<p>Donya Quick is currently a Research Assistant Professor at Stevens
Institute of Technology. Previously she was a Visiting Professor at
Southern Methodist University and Lecturer at Yale. Her current work
involves research is at the intersection of artificial intelligence,
machine learning, music theory, and programming languages. She is also a
composer and have dabbled in other creative areas in the past, and she
has a life-long interest in aquariums, fish, and aquatic
invertebrates.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h1 id="noriegaveinberg">Off&lt;&gt;zzing the Ckalcuλator</h1>

<p>The Ckalcuλator is a lambda-calculus arithmetic calculator for the
piano. It is the fourth sub-system of the CodeKlavier project whose
goal is to become a domain specific programming language that enables
a pianist to live code by playing the piano.</p>

<p>In this performance, duo Off&lt;&gt;zz - Felipe Ignacio Noriega (live
coding) and Anne Veinberg (piano), will give a performance in their
standard formation of live coding in SuperCollider and piano playing
but with the adjustment of Veinberg using the Ckalcuλator system and
thus composing and evaluating simple lambda-calculus arithmetic
operations and number comparisons with her piano playing.</p>

<h3 id="felipe-ignacio-noriega"><a href="https://felipeignacio.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Felipe Ignacio Noriega</a></h3>

<p>Felipe Ignacio Noriega is a composer, programmer and live-coding artist
born in Mexico City and is co-creator of the CodeKlavier together with
Anne Veinberg. He collaborates in various settings where a common
subject is the incorporation of coding as a performative and aesthetic
principle. Ignacio graduated Cum Laude from the Masters in composition
at the Conservatorium van Amsterdam in 2013. He has won various
composition competitions and grants in the Netherlands including the
Young Artist Fund Amsterdam 2015 and the ADE SoundLab 2016. In March
2017 he was awarded a start-phase and development-phase grant from the
Creative Industries Fund NL to develop the CodeKlavier. The first work
of the CodeKlavier, “hello world”, was the winner of the 2017
Uncaged:Conlon Foundation Composition Competition.</p>

<h3 id="anne-veinberg-leiden-universitydocartes"><a href="https://anneveinberg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anne Veinberg, Leiden University/docARTES</a></h3>

<p>Anne Veinberg is an Australian pianist based in the Netherlands and is
co-creator of the CodeKlavier together with Felipe Ignacio
Noriega. Anne is passionate about music of and for today. She
regularly collaborates with composers, actors and technologists to
develop new works and musical experiences. Anne is a member of
Ensemble Scala for microtonal music, of Apituley’s Locomotive Band for

<h1 id="kyriakoudis">On the Branch of a Tree</h1>

<p>All sounds, and by ambitious extension all possible music, can be
imagined to exist as a circular spectrum of equivalent, immutable, and
stateless functions of time.  This performance takes place on a branch
of a tree, somewhere in a forest. The instrument used is TimeLines, a
Haskell-based live coding modular synth, inspired by the FRP
approaches to sound and image of TidalCycles and parallel graphics
shaders respectively.</p>

<h3 id="dimitris-kyriakoudis--infinite-monkeys"><a href="http://lnfinitemonkeys.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dimitris Kyriakoudis,  Infinite Monkeys</a></h3>

<p>Dimitris Kyriakoudis, occasionally known as <code class="highlighter-rouge">w1n5t0n</code>, is one of the
Infinite Monkeys. He was taught music at a young age by being shown
discrete black squiggles, drawn on pieces of white paper, and how to
play them using an array of even more discrete, but equally black and
white, on-off switches.</p>

<p>That turned out to be a bit too boring, so now he can be found sitting
on tree branches, making funny noises using functional programming and
mathematics he can barely understand.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h1 id="tadokoro">Algorave 100 Fragments</h1>

<p>In this performance, Atsushi Tadokoro will unite the audio and visual
stimulus together using Haskell based live coding library TidalCycles.
The application selects a shader animation when detecting the note on
the timing of TidalCycles via OSC, making synchronized complex
animations automatically in real-time.</p>

<h3 id="atsushi-tadokoro-maebashi-institute-of-technology"><a href="https://yoppa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atsushi Tadokoro, Maebashi Institute of Technology</a></h3>

<p>Atsushi Tadokoro is a creative coder. Currently teaching as an
associate professor at Maebashi Institute of Technology, and as a
part-time lecturer at Tokyo University of the Arts and Keio University
in Japan. Tadokoro makes music works of sound synthesis using an
algorithm and performs improvisation with sounds and moving-images by
a laptop. His lectures about “creative coding” and “Live Coding” for
openFrameworks, Processing, Sonic Pi and TidalCycles, etc. are
<a href="http://yoppa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online</a> to be practically used for students and
creators.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h1 id="parduearmitage">Lil Data and Bitchlovsky play the Svampolin</h1>

<p>This performance features live coding and the Svampolin, a hybrid
electric-acoustic violin. The svampolin is a functional decomposition
and recomposition of the violin designed to play, present, feel like,
and even sound like a violin, but can equally sound completely unlike
a violin.  The svampolin is capable of computer communications, and
live programming can be used to redefine performer intimacy as the
coder alters the svampolin’s performative results in
real-time. Changing the instrument’s functionality during a piece, the
player and coder are able to shift the role of the violin from
structure to behaviour, or from lutherie to performance.</p>

<h3 id="laurel-s-pardue-bitchlovsky-queen-mary-university-of-london">Laurel S. Pardue (Bitchlovsky), Queen Mary University of London</h3>

<p>Laurel S. Pardue has worked in music tech and instrument design for
over 15 years capturing complex virtuosic interactions. She focuses on
real-world performance designing hand controllers for Visual Music
Systems, Gamelan Elektrika (debuted with Kronos Quartet at the Lincoln
Center in 2010), electronic tablas for Kuljit Bahmra, and most
recently, the Svampolin. She holds 4 degrees from MIT and completed a
PhD at Queen Mary University of London where she continues research in
collaboration with Aalborg University in Copenhagen looking at
