### Call for Papers

The ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music, Modelling and
Design (FARM) gathers together people who are harnessing functional techniques
in the pursuit of creativity and expression. FARM encourages submissions from
across art, craft, and design, including textiles, visual art, music, 3D
sculpture, animation, GUIs, video games, 3D printing and architectural models,
choreography, poetry, and even VLSI layouts, GPU configurations, or mechanical
engineering designs. Theoretical foundations, language design, implementation
issues, and applications in industry or the arts are all within the scope of the
workshop.

#### Original papers

We solicit original papers in the following categories:

- Original research
- Overview / state of the art
- Technology tutorial

All submissions must propose an original contribution to the FARM
theme. FARM is an interdisciplinary conference, so a wide range of
approaches are encouraged.

An original paper should have 5 to 12 pages, be in portable document
format (PDF), using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines and the [ACM
SIGPLAN template](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/) (use
the 'sigplan' sub-format).

Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library as part
of the FARM 2019 proceedings. See the [information on the options
available to authors](http://authors.acm.org/main.cfm). Authors are
encouraged to submit auxiliary material for publication along with
their paper (source code, data, videos, images, etc.); authors retain
all rights to the auxiliary material.

#### Demo proposals

Demo proposals should describe a demonstration to be given at the FARM
workshop and its context, connecting it with the themes of FARM. A
demo could be in the form of a short (10-20 minute) tutorial,
presentation of work-in-progress, an exhibition of some work, or even
a performance. Demo proposals should be in the
form of an extended abstract (500 to 2000 words). A demo proposal should be
clearly marked as such, by prepending “Demo Proposal:” to the title. Demo
proposals will be published on the FARM website.


### Authors take note

The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made
available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks
prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication
date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published
work.

All presentations at FARM 2019 will be recorded. Permission to publish
the resulting video (in all probability on YouTube, along with the
videos of ICFP itself and the other ICFP-colocated events) will be
requested on-site.

### Finances

If you would have financial difficulty attending, you
can apply for conference "PAC" funds.

Please get in touch for more information.

### Questions

If you have any questions about what type of contributions that might

itself, please contact the organizers at: `farm-2019@functional-art.org`
