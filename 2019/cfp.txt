FARM 2019 Call for Papers, Demos, and Performances
Berlin, Germany, August 23, 2019

The ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music, Modelling and
Design (FARM) gathers together people who are harnessing functional techniques
in the pursuit of creativity and expression. FARM encourages submissions from
across art, craft, and design, including textiles, visual art, music, 3D
sculpture, animation, GUIs, video games, 3D printing and architectural models,
choreography, poetry, and even VLSI layouts, GPU configurations, or mechanical
engineering designs. Theoretical foundations, language design, implementation
issues, and applications in industry or the arts are all within the scope of the
workshop.

PAPERS
We welcome submissions from academic, professional, and independent programmers
and artists. Paper submissions are invited in three categories:

- Original research
- Overview / state of the art
- Technology tutorial

All submissions must propose an original contribution to the FARM theme. FARM is
an interdisciplinary conference, so a wide range of approaches are encouraged.
An original paper should have 5 to 12 pages, be in portable document format
(PDF), and use the ACM SIGPLAN style guides and template (using the SIGPLAN
sub-format). Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library as
part of the FARM 2019 proceedings. See here for information on the options
available to authors. Authors are encouraged to submit auxiliary material for
publication along with their paper (source code, data, videos, images, etc.);
authors retain all rights to the auxiliary material.

DEMO PROPOSALS

Demo proposals should describe a demonstration to be given at the FARM workshop
and its context, connecting it with the themes of FARM. A demo could be in the
form of a short (10-20 minute) tutorial, presentation of work-in-progress, an
exhibition of some work, or even a performance. Demo proposals should be in the
form of an extended abstract (500 to 2000 words). A demo proposal should be
clearly marked as such, by prepending “Demo Proposal:” to the title. Demo
proposals will be published on the FARM website.

PERFORMANCES

FARM also hosts a traditional evening of performances. FARM seeks proposals for
live performances which employ functional programming techniques, in whole or in
part. We would like to support a diverse range of performing arts, including
music, dance, video animation, and performance art. We encourage both
risk-taking proposals which push forward the state of the art and refined
presentations of highly-developed practice. In either case, please support your
submission with a clear description of your performance including how your
performance employs functional programming and a discussion of influences and
prior art as appropriate.

Important dates/deadlines:
Submission deadline: May 27th (extended from May 15th)
Reviews returned: June 17th
Camera ready submissions: June 30th
