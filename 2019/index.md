## 7th ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music, Modeling and Design (FARM)

<img src="/files/farm-lambda-small.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;" />

**23rd August, 2019**, co-located with
[ICFP 2019](https://icfp19.sigplan.org/) in Berlin, Germany

### About

The ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music,
Modelling and Design (FARM) gathers together people who are harnessing
functional techniques in the pursuit of creativity and expression.

Functional Programming has emerged as a mainstream software
development paradigm, and its artistic and creative use is booming. A
growing number of software toolkits, frameworks and environments for
art, music and design now employ functional programming languages and
techniques. FARM is a forum for exploration and critical evaluation of
these developments, for example to consider potential benefits of
greater consistency, tersity, and closer mapping to a problem domain.

FARM encourages submissions from across art, craft and design,
including textiles, visual art, music, 3D sculpture, animation, GUIs,
video games, 3D printing and architectural models, choreography,
poetry, and even VLSI layouts, GPU configurations, or mechanical
engineering designs. Theoretical foundations, language design,
implementation issues, and applications in industry or the arts are
all within the scope of the workshop. The language used need not be
purely functional (“mostly functional” is fine), and may be manifested
as a domain specific language or tool. Moreover, submissions focusing
on questions or issues about the use of functional programming are
within the scope.

### Call for Papers and Demos

Submission deadline: May 15, 2019

[**Submission page on Easychair**](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=farm2019)

We welcome submissions from academic, professional, and independent
programmers and artists.

Submissions are invited in two categories:

#### Original papers

We solicit original papers in the following categories:

- Original research
- Overview / state of the art
- Technology tutorial

All submissions must propose an original contribution to the FARM
theme. FARM is an interdisciplinary conference, so a wide range of
approaches are encouraged.

An original paper should have 10 to 25 pages, be in portable document
format (PDF), using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines and the [ACM
SIGPLAN template](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/) (use
the 'sigplan' sub-format).

Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library as part
of the FARM 2019 proceedings. See the [information on the options
available to authors](http://authors.acm.org/main.cfm). Authors are
encouraged to submit auxiliary material for publication along with
their paper (source code, data, videos, images, etc.); authors retain
all rights to the auxiliary material.

#### Demo proposals

Demo proposals should describe a demonstration to be given at the FARM
workshop and its context, connecting it with the themes of FARM. A
demo could be in the form of a short (10-20 minute) tutorial,
presentation of work-in-progress, an exhibition of some work, or even
a performance. Demo proposals should be in plain text, HTML or
Markdown format, and not exceed 2000 words. A demo proposal should be
clearly marked as such, by prepending Demo Proposal: to the title.

Demo proposals should be in the form of extended abstracts and will be
published on the FARM website. A summary of the
demo performances will also be published as part of the conference
proceedings, to be prepared by the program chair.

### Authors take note

The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made
available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks
prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication
date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published
work.

All presentations at FARM 2019 will be recorded. Permission to publish
the resulting video (in all probability on YouTube, along with the
videos of ICFP itself and the other ICFP-colocated events) will be
requested on-site.

### Finances

If you would have financial difficulty attending, you
can apply for conference "PAC" funds.

Please get in touch for more information.

### Questions

If you have any questions about what type of contributions that might
be suitable, or anything else regarding submission or the workshop
itself, please contact the organisers at: `farm-2019@functional-art.org`
