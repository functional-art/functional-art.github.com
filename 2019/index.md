## 7th ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music, Modeling and Design (FARM)

<img src="/files/farm-lambda-small.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;" />

**23rd August, 2019**, co-located with
[ICFP 2019](https://icfp19.sigplan.org/) in Berlin, Germany

### About

The ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music,
Modelling and Design (FARM) gathers together people who are harnessing
functional techniques in the pursuit of creativity and expression.

Functional Programming has emerged as a mainstream software
development paradigm, and its artistic and creative use is booming. A
growing number of software toolkits, frameworks and environments for
art, music and design now employ functional programming languages and
techniques. FARM is a forum for exploration and critical evaluation of
these developments, for example to consider potential benefits of
greater consistency, tersity, and closer mapping to a problem domain.

FARM encourages submissions from across art, craft and design,
including textiles, visual art, music, 3D sculpture, animation, GUIs,
video games, 3D printing and architectural models, choreography,
poetry, and even VLSI layouts, GPU configurations, or mechanical
engineering designs. Theoretical foundations, language design,
implementation issues, and applications in industry or the arts are
all within the scope of the workshop. The language used need not be
purely functional (“mostly functional” is fine), and may be manifested
as a domain specific language or tool. Moreover, submissions focusing
on questions or issues about the use of functional programming are
within the scope.


#### Workshop Registration

**Registration for FARM 2019 has closed.**
You could previously register for the FARM workshop through the
[ICFP registration page](http://icfp19.sigplan.org/attending/registration).

At least one author of each accepted submission must register and present their paper at the workshop.

## 20:30 [Performance Evening](performance.html), [malzfabrik](http://www.malzfabrik.de/)

An [evening of strange and wonderful music and audio/visual work](performance.html) made
from computer code. Featuring an international line-up of artists,
including groundbreaking livecoders who work directly with the innards
of software, writing and manipulating code while a computer runs it,
projecting their screens so you can see the code behind the
performance.

Performances will include: interactive generated jazz, a co-performance
with harmonica and melodica, three duets, a sitar-computer
co-performance, audio-visual animations, and a hybrid electric-acoustic
violin.
