## FARM 2020 Call for Performances

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Jersey City, New Jersey, United States</span>
**Now Virtual**, August 28, 2020
Please note: due to the current circumstances, the papers/demos aspect of FARM has been 
canceled this year. However, we are still intending to hold a virtual 
performance event affiliated with ICFP. The call for performances will 
remain open through August 1st.

### Performance Proposals

The ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music, Modelling and
Design (FARM) seeks audio/visual works that utilize functional programming techniques. Submissions 
need not be completely made with functional techniques - hybrid works are also welcome. 
Both fixed media and interactive systems are welcome, and we encourage a creative 
interpretation of what ‘performance’ means in order to encompass a truly broad range of 
creative functional endeavors. We also encourage submissions from people of all backgrounds
– students, hobbyists, and professionals alike.

FARM invites a diverse range of functionally-themed submissions including music, video, dance, 
and performance art. We encourage both risk-taking proposals that push forward the state of 
the art and refined presentations of highly developed practice. There are no 
submission/registration fees for FARM performers. 

Works created in part or in whole by autonomous systems are also welcome, but subject 
to the constraint that the submitting author(s) must have made a significant contribution 
to the creation of the system itself. 

Due to current travel restrictions and social distancing guidelines, all performances will 
be held online.  Details of the exact technological accommodations available for this at 
ICFP are still forthcoming. As such, creating recordings of live audio/visual works as a 
backup option is strongly encouraged.

All performance submissions should be made using EasyChair. Please send any questions 
regarding performances directly to Donya Quick (donyaquick@gmail.com).
