FARM 2020 Call for Papers, Demos, and Performances
Jersey City, New Jersey, United States, August 28, 2020

The ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music, Modelling and
Design (FARM) gathers together people who are harnessing functional techniques
in the pursuit of creativity and expression. FARM encourages submissions from
across art, craft, and design, including textiles, visual art, music, 3D
sculpture, animation, GUIs, video games, 3D printing and architectural models,
choreography, poetry, and even VLSI layouts, GPU configurations, or mechanical
engineering designs. Theoretical foundations, language design, implementation
issues, and applications in industry or the arts are all within the scope of the
workshop.

In addition to the main workshop, FARM hosts a traditional evening of
performances.  Thus, this call encompasses both papers/demos for the workshop
(and its published proceedings) as well as performance proposals for the
evening's event.  Authors are invited to make a single submission for each.
Authors may submit both a paper/demo and performance proposal, but the
submissions will be considered independently.

PAPERS

We welcome submissions from academic, professional, and independent programmers
and artists. Paper submissions are invited in three categories:

- Original research
- Overview / state of the art
- Technology tutorial

All submissions must propose an original contribution to the FARM theme. FARM is
an interdisciplinary conference, so a wide range of approaches are encouraged.
An original paper should have 5 to 12 pages, be in portable document format
(PDF), and use the ACM SIGPLAN style guides and template (using the SIGPLAN
sub-format). Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library as
part of the FARM 2020 proceedings. See here for information on the options
available to authors. Authors are encouraged to submit auxiliary material for
publication along with their paper (source code, data, videos, images, etc.);
authors retain all rights to the auxiliary material.

DEMO PROPOSALS

Demo proposals should describe a demonstration to be given at the FARM workshop
and its context, connecting it with the themes of FARM. A demo could be in the
form of a short (10-20 minute) tutorial, presentation of work-in-progress, an
exhibition of some work, or even a performance. Demo proposals should be in the
form of an extended abstract (500 to 2000 words). A demo proposal should be
clearly marked as such, by prepending “Demo Proposal:” to the title. Demo
proposals will be published on the FARM website.

PERFORMANCE PROPOSALS

FARM seeks proposals for performances which employ functional programming
techniques, in whole or in part. We invite a diverse range of
functionally-themed submissions including music, video, dance, and performance
art. Both live performances and fixed-media submissions are welcome. We
encourage both risk-taking proposals that push forward the state of the art and
refined presentations of highly developed practice. Please support your
submission with a clear description of your intended performance including how
it employs functional programming techniques and a description of the
technical/equipment requirements for your performance.

IMPORTANT DATES/DEADLINES:

Submission Deadline: May 15th
Author Notification: June 19th
Camera Ready:        July 3rd
Workshop:            August 28th

SUBMISSION

Submissions for papers and demos are accepted via the
[**Submission page on Easychair**](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=farm2020).

Submissions for performance proposals should be sent to:
[`performance@functional-art.org`](mailto:performance@functional-art.org).
We prefer submissions in plaintext/markdown, odf (libre office), doc/docx
(Microsoft Word) or pdf formats. We will confirm receipt by return.

AUTHORS TAKE NOTE

For original papers and demos, the official publication date is the date the
proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up
to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication
date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

All presentations at FARM 2020 will be recorded. Permission to publish the
resulting video (in all probability on YouTube, along with the videos of ICFP
itself and the other ICFP-colocated events) will be requested on-site.

FINANCES

If you would have financial difficulty attending, you can apply for conference
"PAC" funds. Please get in touch for more information.

QUESTIONS

If you have any questions about what type of contributions that might be
suitable, or anything else regarding submission or the workshop itself, please
contact the organizers at: `farm-2020@functional-art.org`
