## 4th ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music, Modelling and Design

# Call for Performances

### Nara, Japan, 24 September, 2016

The ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music,
Modelling and Design (FARM) gathers together people who are harnessing
functional techniques in the pursuit of creativity and expression.

FARM also hosts an evening of performances, which closes
[ICFP 2016](http://conf.researchr.org/home/icfp-2016).  For that
evening,
FARM 2016 is seeking proposals for live performances (audio, visual,
or both) which employ functional programming techniques in whole or in
part.

### Push forward the state of the art!

We encourage both risk-taking proposals which push forward the state
of the art and refined presentations of highly-developed practice. In
either case, please support your submission with a clear description
of your performance including how your performance employs functional
programming and a discussion of influences and prior art as
appropriate.

To propose a performance for the conference, please submit a a brief
outline/programme note (100-150 words), a stable link to a single
video example, possibly a stable link to one additional audio example,
and a short biography (100-150 words for each contributor).

### Entertain!

We are also accepting submissions for brief but exceptionally
entertaining performances, the standard of "entertaining" being
completely up to the discretion of the program committee.

### Submission process

Please include a complete technical description of what is needed from
the organizers for your performance, including equipment, space
requirements, and internet access. Works should not exceed 20 minutes
in length.

Send your submission to:

[`performance@functional-art.org`](mailto:performance@functional-art.org)


The deadline for proposals is
<a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=FARM+2016+Performance Submission+Deadline&iso=20160824T235959&p1=%3A">August
24</a>.

A summary of the performances will also be published as part of the
conference proceedings, to be prepared by the performance chair.

As with presentations, all performances at FARM 2016 will be recorded.
Permission to publish the resulting video (in all probability on
YouTube, along with the videos of ICFP itself and the other
ICFP-colocated events) will be requested on-site.
