## 4rd ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music, Modelling and Design

# Call for Papers and Demos

### Nara, Japan, 24 September, 2016

The ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music,
Modelling and Design (FARM) gathers together people who are harnessing
functional techniques in the pursuit of creativity and expression.

Functional Programming has emerged as a mainstream software development
paradigm, and its artistic and creative use is booming. A growing number
of software toolkits, frameworks and environments for art, music and
design now employ functional programming languages and techniques. FARM
is a forum for exploration and critical evaluation of these
developments, for example to consider potential benefits of greater
consistency, tersity, and closer mapping to a problem domain.

FARM encourages submissions from across art, craft and design,
including textiles, visual art, music, 3D sculpture, animation, GUIs,
video games, 3D printing and architectural models, choreography,
poetry, and even VLSI layouts, GPU configurations, or mechanical
engineering designs. Theoretical foundations, language design,
implementation issues, and applications in industry or the arts are
all within the scope of the workshop.  The language used need not be
purely functional ("mostly functional" is fine), and may be manifested
as a domain specific language or tool.  Moreover, submissions
focussing on questions or issues about the use of functional
programming are within the scope.


## Submissions

Submissions are invited in several categories:

#### Original papers 

We solicit original papers in the following categories:

* original research
* overview / state of the art
* technology tutorial

All submissions must propose an original contribution to the FARM
theme.  FARM 2016 is an interdisciplinary conference, so a wide range
of approaches are encouraged.

An original paper should have 5 to 12 pages, be in portable
document format (PDF), using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines and
use the [ACM SIGPLAN template](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/).

Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library as part
of the FARM 2016 proceedings.  See
[http://authors.acm.org/main.cfm](this page) for information on the
options available to authors. Authors are encouraged to submit
auxiliary material for publication along with their paper (source
code, data, videos, images, etc.); authors retain all rights to the
auxiliary material.

#### Demo proposals

Demo proposals should describe a demonstration to be given at the FARM
workshop and its context,
connecting it with the themes of FARM. A demo could be in the form of a
short (10-20 minute) tutorial, presentation of work-in-progress, an
exhibition of some work, or even a performance.  Demo proposals should
be in plain text, HTML or Markdown format, and not exceed 2000 words.

Demo proposals will be published on the FARM website.

#### Calls for collaboration

Calls for collaboration should describe a need for technology or expertise
related to the FARM theme.  Examples may include but are not
restricted to:

* art projects in need of realization
* existing software or hardware that may benefit from functional
  programming
* unfinished projects in need of inspiration

Calls for help should be in plain text, HTML or Markdown format, and
not exceed 5000 words.

Calls for help will be published on the FARM website.

#### Submission is via EasyChair:

### Questions

If you have any questions about what type of contributions that might be
suitable, or anything else regarding submission or the workshop itself,
please contact the organisers at:

[`farm-2016@functional-art.org`](mailto:farm-2016@functional-art.org)

All presentations at FARM 2016 will be recorded.  Permission to
publish the resulting video will be requested on-site.
