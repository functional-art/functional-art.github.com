## 4rd ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music, Modelling and Design

# Call for Papers and Demos

### Nara, Japan, X September, 2016

The ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music,
Modelling and Design (FARM) gathers together people who are harnessing
functional techniques in the pursuit of creativity and expression.

Functional Programming has emerged as a mainstream software development
paradigm, and its artistic and creative use is booming. A growing number
of software toolkits, frameworks and environments for art, music and
design now employ functional programming languages and techniques. FARM
is a forum for exploration and critical evaluation of these
developments, for example to consider potential benefits of greater
consistency, tersity, and closer mapping to a problem domain.

FARM encourages submissions from across art, craft and design, including
textiles, visual art, music, 3D sculpture, animation, GUIs, video games,
3D printing and architectural models, choreography, poetry, and even
VLSI layouts, GPU configurations, or mechanical engineering designs. The
language used need not be purely functional ("mostly functional" is
fine), and may be manifested as a domain specific language or
tool.  Theoretical foundations, language design, implementation issues,
and applications in industry or the arts are all within the scope of the
workshop.

**Submissions are invited in two categories:**

#### Full papers 

5 to 12 pages using the ACM SIGPLAN template. FARM 2016 is an
interdisciplinary conference, so a wide range of approaches are
encouraged and we recognize that the appropriate length of a paper may
vary considerably depending on the approach. However, all submissions
must propose an original contribution to the FARM theme, cite relevant
previous work, and apply appropriate research methods.


#### Demo abstracts

Demo abstracts should describe the demonstration and its context,
connecting it with the themes of FARM. A demo could be in the form of a
short (10-20 minute) tutorial, presentation of work-in-progress, an
exhibition of some work, or even a performance. Abstracts should be no
longer than 2 pages, using the ACM SIGPLAN template and will be subject
to a light-touch peer review.

If you have any questions about what type of contributions that might be
suitable, or anything else regarding submission or the workshop itself,
please contact the organisers at:
