### Registration

*Registration is open!*

You can register via the ICFP 2014 registration
[here](https://regmaster4.com/2014conf/ICFP14/register.php).

Don't be confused that it says "ICFP" - FARM is part of a larger event
around [ICFP 2014](http://icfpconference.org/icfp2014/), and you can
register for FARM without registering for ICFP.

### About

The ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music,
Modelling and Design (FARM) gathers together people who are harnessing
functional techniques in the pursuit of creativity and expression.

Functional Programming has emerged as a mainstream software
development paradigm, and its artistic and creative use is booming. A
growing number of software toolkits, frameworks and environments for
art, music and design now employ functional programming languages and
techniques. FARM is a forum for exploration and critical evaluation of
these developments, for example to consider potential benefits of
greater consistency, tersity, and closer mapping to a problem domain.
