## Workshop on Functional Art, Music, Modeling and Design (FARM)

<img src="/files/farm-lambda-small.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;" />

**September 6, 2014**, co-located with [ICFP
2014](http://icfpconference.org/icfp2014/) in Gothenburg, Sweden

### About

The functional programming community is largely interested in writing
beautiful programs. The ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on
Functional Art, Music, Modelling and Design (FARM) is intended to
gather researchers and practitioners interested in writing **beautiful
programs which generate beautiful artifacts or experiences**, or perhaps
even challenge notions of beauty. FARM encourages submissions from
across art, craft and design, including textiles, visual art, music,
3D sculpture, animation, GUIs, video games, physical models,
architectural models, choreographies for dance, poetry, and even VLSI
layouts, GPU configurations, or mechanical engineering designs. The
language used need not be purely functional ("mostly functional" is
fine); may be based on abstractions such as higher-order functions,
monads, arrows, or streams; and may be manifested as a domain specific
language or tool. Theoretical foundations, language design,
implementation issues, and applications in industry or the arts are
all within the scope of the workshop.

### Submit a paper or a demo proposal!
