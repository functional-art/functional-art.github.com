### About

The ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music,
Modelling and Design (FARM) gathers together people who are harnessing
functional techniques in the pursuit of creativity and expression.

Functional Programming has emerged as a mainstream software
development paradigm, and its artistic and creative use is booming. A
growing number of software toolkits, frameworks and environments for
art, music and design now employ functional programming languages and
techniques. FARM is a forum for exploration and critical evaluation of
these developments, for example to consider potential benefits of
greater consistency, tersity, and closer mapping to a problem domain.

### Program

We are currently assembling the program, to be announced soon.

### Live Performances

On the evening of September 6 (after the workshop) we will have an
evening of live performances at [3:e VÃ¥ningen](http://www.3vaningen.se/) (3rd floor), in collaboration with
