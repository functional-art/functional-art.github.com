### Getting to the venue

**Important note:** The performance venue does not serve food, so make
sure you get something to eat before getting there.

You have several options for getting to the conference venue:

#### By group

A group will meet near the registration area at **6:40PM** and then
take a tram to the venue.

We will all go down to the Pressbyrå and buy tickets.  Count on
needing SEK 50 for a return ticket.

**Important note:** The performance venue does not serve food, so make
sure you get something to eat before leaving.

#### By tram

You can find out several alternative public transport options on the
[Västrafik site](http://www.vasttrafik.se/#!/en/).

Key in from "Korsvägen, Göteborg" to "Sockerbruket 9, 414 51 Göteborg".

We recommend buying a ticket beforehand at the Pressbyrån shop at
the Korsvägen stop.

The venue is a fairly long walk from the conference venue - about
1h15.  The address of the venue is "Sockerbruket 9 Göteborg".
