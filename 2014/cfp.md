## 2nd ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music, Modelling and Design

# Call for Papers and Demos

### Gothenburg, Sweden; 6 September, 2014

The ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music,
Modelling and Design (FARM) gathers together people who are harnessing
functional techniques in the pursuit of creativity and expression.

Functional Programming has emerged as a mainstream software
development paradigm, and its artistic and creative use is booming. A
growing number of software toolkits, frameworks and environments for
art, music and design now employ functional programming languages and
techniques. FARM is a forum for exploration and critical evaluation of
these developments, for example to consider potential benefits of
greater consistency, tersity, and closer mapping to a problem domain.

FARM encourages submissions from across art, craft and design,
including textiles, visual art, music, 3D sculpture, animation, GUIs,
video games, 3D printing and architectural models, choreography,
poetry, and even VLSI layouts, GPU configurations, or mechanical
engineering designs. The language used need not be purely functional
(~mostly functional~ is fine), and may be manifested as a domain
specific language or tool. Theoretical foundations, language design,
implementation issues, and applications in industry or the arts are
all within the scope of the workshop.

**Submissions are invited in two categories:**

#### Full papers

5 to 12 pages using the ACM SIGPLAN template. FARM 2014 is an
interdisciplinary conference, so a wide range of approaches are
encouraged and we recognize that the appropriate length of a paper may
vary considerably depending on the approach. However, all submissions
must propose an original contribution to the FARM theme, cite relevant
previous work, and apply appropriate research methods.

#### Demo abstracts

Demo abstracts should describe the demonstration and its context,
connecting it with the themes of FARM. A demo could be in the form of
a short (10-20 minute) tutorial, presentation of work-in-progress, an
exhibition of some work, or even a performance. Abstracts should be no
longer than 2 pages, using the ACM SIGPLAN template and will be
subject to a light-touch peer review.

If you have any questions about what type of contributions that might
be suitable, or anything else regarding submission or the workshop
itself, please contact the organisers at:
