<div class="sectionhead">About</div>

<div class="section">
<p>The functional programming community is largely interested in writing beautiful programs. This workshop is intended to gather researchers and practitioners interested in writing <strong>beautiful programs that generate beautiful artifacts</strong>. Such artifacts may include visual art, music, 3D sculptures, animations, GUIs, video games, physical models, architectural models, choreographies for dance, poetry, and even physical objects such as VLSI layouts, GPU configurations, or mechanical engineering designs. The framework used need not be purely functional (“mostly functional” is fine); may be based on abstractions such as higher-order functions, monads, arrows, or streams; and may be manifested as a domain specific language or tool. Theoretical foundations, language design, implementation issues, and applications are all within the scope of the workshop.</p>

<div class="sectionhead">CFP and Paper Submission</div>

<div class="section">
<p>There will be a formal proceedings published by ACM Press. Accepted papers will be included in the ACM Digital Library; see <a href="http://authors.acm.org/main.cfm">http://authors.acm.org/main.cfm</a> for information on the options available to authors. Authors are also encouraged to submit auxiliary material for publication along with their paper (source code, data, videos, images, etc.); authors retain all rights to the auxiliary material.</p>
<p>We solicit submissions in two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Full papers. A full paper is limited to 12 pages, and will be evaluated according to its relevance, correctness, significance, originality, and clarity. It should explain its contributions, identify what has been accomplished, explain why it is significant, and compare it with previous work.</p></li>
<li><p>“Aesthetic applications”. An aesthetic application paper is limited to 6 pages, and will be judged primarily on the effective and elegant use of FP to generate aesthetic artifacts (though the criteria for full papers are still relevant).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Submitted papers should be in portable document format (PDF), formatted using the <a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm">ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines</a>. The text should be in a 9-point font in two columns.</p>
<p>Submissions can be made via EasyChair at <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=farm2013">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=farm2013</a>.</p>
</div>



<div class="sectionhead">Call for Demo Proposals</div>

<div class="section">
<p>Do you enjoy writing beautiful code to produce beautiful artifacts? Have something cool to show off at the intersection of functional programming and visual art, music, sound, modeling, visualization, or design?</p>
<p>FARM 2013 is seeking proposals for 10-20 minute demonstrations to be given during the workshop. For example, a demonstration could consist of a short tutorial, an exhibition of some work, or even a livecoding performance. Slots for demonstrations will be shorter than slots for accepted papers, and will not be published as part of the formal proceedings, but can be a great way to show off interesting work and get feedback from other workshop participants. A demonstration slot could be a particularly good way to get feedback on work-in-progress.</p>
<p>A demo proposal should consist of a 1 page abstract, in PDF format, explaining the proposed content of the demonstration and why it would be of interest to the attendees of FARM. Proposals will be judged on interest and relevance to the stated goals and themes of the workshop.</p>
<p>Submissions can be made via EasyChair at <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=farm2013">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=farm2013</a>.</p>
