<img src="/files/farm-lambda-small.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px; width:30em" />

**16th September, 2022**, co-virtual with
[ICFP 2022](https://icfp21.sigplan.org/), held in Ljubljana, Slovenia.

### Key Dates

| Submission deadline        || June 1 |
| Author notification              || July 1   |
| Workshop                         || September 16 |

### Call for Papers

The ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music,
Modelling and Design (FARM) encourages submissions from across art,
craft, and design, including textiles, visual art, music, 3D
sculpture, animation, GUIs, video games, 3D printing and architectural
models, choreography, poetry, and even VLSI layouts, GPU
configurations, or mechanical engineering designs. Theoretical
foundations, language design, implementation issues, and applications
in industry or the arts are all within the scope of the workshop.

In addition to the main workshop, FARM hosts a traditional evening of
performances. Thus, this call encompasses both papers/demos for the
workshop (and its published proceedings) as well as performance
proposals for the evening's event. Authors are invited to make a
single submission for each. Authors may submit both a paper/demo and
performance proposal, but the submissions will be considered
independently.

# Note on Finances

Paid registration to the FARM workshop is usually required for paper
and demo submitters, but will be waived for performers.

If you would have financial difficulty attending, you can apply for
conference "PAC" funds. Please get in touch for more information.

# Papers

Paper submissions are invited in three categories:

- Original research
- Overview / state of the art
- Technology tutorial (especially tools and environments for distributed artistic workflow)

Papers must be submitted via [HotCRP](https://farm22.hotcrp.com/), and
meet the following requirements:

- 5 to 12 pages
- PDF format
- Adhere to the [ACM SIGPLAN template](https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/ProceedingsFormat/)

Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library as part
of the FARM 2022 proceedings.

Authors are encouraged to submit auxiliary material for publication
along with their paper (source code, data, videos, images,
etc.). Authors retain all rights to the auxiliary material.

## Demos

Demo submissions should describe a demonstration and its context,
connecting it with the themes of FARM. A demo could be in the form of
a short (10 to 20 minute) tutorial, a presentation of work in
progress, an exhibition of some work, or even a performance.

Demos must be submitted via [HotCRP](https://farm22.hotcrp.com/), and
meet the following requirements:

- 500 to 2000 words
- Have a title starting with “Demo: ”
- PDF format
- Adhere to the [ACM SIGPLAN template](https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/ProceedingsFormat/)

Accepted demos will be published in the ACM Digital Library as part of
the FARM 2022 proceedings.

## Parformances

FARM seeks proposals for performances which employ functional
programming techniques, in whole or in part. We invite a diverse range
of functionally-themed submissions including music, video, dance, and
performance art. Both live performances and fixed-media submissions
are welcome. We encourage risk-taking proposals that push forward the
state of the art as well as refined presentations of highly developed
practice. In either case, please support your submission with a clear
description of your performance, including how your performance
employs functional programming and a discussion of influences and
prior art as appropriate.

Performance proposals should be emailed to
[`performance@functional-art.org`](performance@functional-art.org),
and must include:

- A description of the performance (please be as specific as possible)
- An explanation of the use of functional programming in the work
- A list of technical requirements
- A link to an audio or video example (YouTube, Vimeo, Bandcamp, etc.)

Accepted performances will be presented at the performance evening.
