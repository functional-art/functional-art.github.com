## 10th ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music, Modeling and Design (FARM)

**15th September, 2022**, co-virtual with
[ICFP 2022](https://icfp22.sigplan.org/), held in Ljubljana, Slovenia.

## About

The ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music,
Modelling and Design (FARM) gathers together people who are harnessing
functional techniques in the pursuit of creativity and expression.

Functional Programming has emerged as a mainstream software
development paradigm, and its artistic and creative use is booming. A
growing number of software toolkits, frameworks and environments for
art, music and design now employ functional programming languages and
techniques. FARM is a forum for exploration and critical evaluation of
these developments, for example to consider potential benefits of
greater consistency, tersity, and closer mapping to a problem domain.

FARM encourages submissions from across art, craft and design,
including textiles, visual art, music, 3D sculpture, animation, GUIs,
video games, 3D printing and architectural models, choreography,
poetry, and even VLSI layouts, GPU configurations, or mechanical
engineering designs. Theoretical foundations, language design,
implementation issues, and applications in industry or the arts are
all within the scope of the workshop. The language used need not be
purely functional (“mostly functional” is fine), and may be manifested
as a domain specific language or tool. Moreover, submissions focusing
on questions or issues about the use of functional programming are
within the scope.

## Schedule

16:00-17:00 FARM demos

19:00-20:00 FARM keynote

20:00-22:00 FARM performances

## Program

This year, we'll do the keynote, demos and the performance evening all
on the evening of Thursday, September 15.

The event is open to the public.  Very reasonably-priced tickets will
be available at the venue.  Admissions is free for folks registered
for ICFP.

The schedule can also be found on the
[ICFP conference website](https://icfp22.sigplan.org/home/farm-2022#program).

### Performances
  
#### [Rob Canning](https://www.mfru.org/people/rob-caning) - Fold Yer Loops!

*Fold Yer Loops!* is a solo electronic music performance for augmented
electric guitar and computer. The guitar is augmented with extra
switches, capacitive buttons and potentiometers as well as an
accelerometer and gyroscope capturing the movement of the
instrument. An ESP32 low energy microcomputer translates the inputs to
Open Sound Control (OSC) messages and sends them over Bluetooth to the
computer, where they control custom Supercollider code that
manipulates the live guitar sound in real-time.

These technologies all combine to give the performer an enhanced set
of both sonic and gestural possibilities while interacting with the
instrument. Stylistically, the music oscillates between ambient
minimalism and avant noise drone while being peppered with a heavy
dose of free improvisation and mutant rock noises.

#### [Enrico Dorigatti](https://www.enricodorigatti.com/) - Xeno

Xeno is an experimental, abstract short film based on the intense, dense and continuous twine between audio and video.

Our concept and perception of sounds derive from a world where sonic events are always the consequences of physical actions. Xeno aims to 
break this rule by employing creatively the audio-video relationship, in a scenario where sonic and visual objects appear simultaneously, yet 
with an undefined linkage. It creates and proposes an altered, alien reality in which the action-reaction bond is puzzled and jeopardised 
and, consequently, our perception and experience become deceptive. Which media is the cause or consequence of the other? Does a relationship 
really exist?

#### Francesco Corvi aka [Nesso](https://nesso.xyz/) - Live coding
with Adapt

Despite the enormous creative potential, most of the recent
developments in live coding are based on the idea of the sequencer and
the drum machine where events are associated to notes as discrete
moments in a parametric space.

Nesso's performance challenges this convention by using the Adapt
sound engine, in which modules defining sound processes combine
themselves in a network of influences, creating evolving sound
morphologies. In this way, the machine gains a degree of autonomy by
listening to its own output and analyzing the current configuration of
the routings between these modules. The performer continuously
interacts with this evolving system, trying to manage its behavior
over time by altering the structure while discovering new
possibilities and configurations.

#### [Luka Prinčič](https://music.lukaprincic.si/) - Algoforte

*Algoforte* is a livecoded performance involving a Disklavier (a
player-piano that is controlled via midi), two microphones, a sound
amplification system and a laptop performer displaying their
programming interface on a video projection screen. While the sound of
the piano is picked up through the microphones and amplified, it is
also captured into the live audio system and the sound is recorded,
processed and manipulated further in realtime, with the results added
to the speakers mix. The performer sits next to the piano, which plays
based on live midi instructions produced by algorithms that are
written in real time. The performer does not touch the piano but
concentrates on his programming which is clearly visible on the
projection.

#### [Flor De Fuego](https://flordefuego.github.io/) - Specific site: remembering is never a faithful copy

The proposal of this project is to approach memory as a concept
through space and time as a living and interactive entity. A metaphor
of how we interact with objects and the environment and the relation
of this with the digital world.

This is an audiovisual live coding performance constituted by a
virtual VR space where 3D photogrammetry sculptures and sound are
being distorted in real time.

Through the usage of live coding tools such as Hydra and Orca, the
proposal connects everything as an experience to travel through
different live coded universes on this DIY browser instrument.
